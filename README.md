# e-gingrich // Advent of Code 2020
My goal for my first advent of code is to:
1) Try and finish all the problems. Even if I can't get full solutions, getting something is the goal.
2) Learn new languages and brush up on one's I've used in classes

The languages I'm going to be using this month are:
C++, Java, Javascript, Python, COBOL (Yeah, you heard right), C#, and Go.

This gives me 7 languages that I can spread out over a week. I've already done day 1 in C++, so the rest of the schedule will go as follows:
- Dec. 1 - C++ (Finished)
- Dec. 2 - Java
- Dec. 3 - Python
- Dec. 4 - COBOL
- Dec. 5 - C#
- Dec. 6 - Go
- Dec. 7 - TBD
...and then the cycle repeats itself until the end.

Hopefully, by the end of this, I'll have a decent understanding of COBOL, C#, and Go, all of which I do not know at all. 
Also, I hope to better understand Java,  which I haven't used much of since freshman year of Uni. And finally, I want to get much more comfortable with doing any sort of problem in C++ and Python. For these two languages, I'll focus more on figuring out the problems in different ways or more efficient ways if I possibly can.
